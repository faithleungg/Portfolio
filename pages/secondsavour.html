            Second Savour is a food startup repurposing imperfect produce into
            healthy candy alternatives through the product line, “Citrus
            Treats.”

            As the sole designer, I created the visual identity and creative
            direction for the brand. My work includes product packaging, brand
            assets, and digital marketing.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <h4>
            Originating as a university project, Second Savour needed to evolve
            into a market-ready product.
          </h4>

                customers

        <div class="case-chunk">
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <h4>
            Initially, the simplicity of the original packaging appealed, but I realized that candy is sweet and fun, and the packaging needed to reflect that.
          </h4>

            I experimented with bright backgrounds and landed on orange to accurately represent the upcycled orange peel candies. My first iteration was bold, showcasing sticker elements and angled text to convey playfulness.

          <h3>Second Iteration</h3>
          <h4>
            After receiving customer feedback, I removed the angled elements, increased contrast, and introduced a mascot to bring personality to the brand. I also selected a new typeface that would become the brand’s defining font.

        <div class="case-chunk">
          <h3>Final Iteration</h3>
          <h4>
            For the final iteration, I revised the stickers with descriptive product words, adjusted the front angle to spark curiosity, reincorporated the mascot, fixed hierarchy issues, and rewrote the back content to highlight flexible uses rather than the company story.

            Along with packaging, I created a new brand identity. A bold and playful look, combining illustrative styles with round typefaces to communicate a refreshing, down to earth personality.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <h5>
            Working as the sole designer at a startup required a lot of self-learning and initiative. I learned to justify my design decisions, ensuring content was meaningful. Creating a sellable product meant every element directly influenced the product’s growth and appeal. At the same time, being part of a small team allowed me to collaborate cross-functionally and gain insight into areas beyond design, including product strategy and marketing, skills I will carry into my career.
