            Second Savour is a food startup repurposing imperfect produce into
            healthy candy alternatives through the product line, “Citrus
            Treats.”
          </h4>

            As the sole designer, I created the visual identity and creative
            direction for the brand. My work includes product packaging, brand
            assets, and digital marketing.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <h4>
            Originating as a university project, Second Savour needed to evolve
            into a market-ready product.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Minimalism was cool, but didn't reflect the sweet and fun nature of candy (this was the previous packaging).

                <h5>Candy brands often rely on strong taglines.</h5>
                <h5>Value propositions should be communicated upfront.</h5>

          <h3>First Iteration</h3>
          <h4>
            My first iteration was bold, showcasing sticker elements and angled labels to convey playfulness. I chose a bright orange background to represent the upcycled orange peels used.
          </h4>

            Customers didn't understand the angled labels, so I removed them. I introduced a mascot to bring personality to the brand and selected a new typeface that would become the brand’s defining font.

            However, the design still felt incohesive, and the brand started to introduce new flavours. The product struggled to sell itself without a pitch.

        <div class="case-chunk">
          <h3>Solution</h3>

            I revised the stickers with descriptive product words, paired type hierarchies together, reincorporated the mascot, and reiterated copy writing to highlight the product rather than the company.

            Second Savour's new packging effectively scales across multiple flavours, showcasing a bold and playful look which combines illustrative styles with round typefaces to communicate their refreshing, down to earth personality.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <h5>
            Working as the sole designer at a startup required a lot of self-learning and initiative. I learned to justify my design decisions, ensuring content was meaningful. Creating a sellable product meant every element directly influenced the product’s growth and appeal. At the same time, being part of a small team allowed me to collaborate cross-functionally and gain insight into areas beyond design, including product strategy and marketing, skills I will carry into my career.
